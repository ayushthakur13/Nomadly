# 🌍 Nomadly

> Project status: In Progress (actively developed). Many features are implemented; others are planned or partially available. See checklists below.

Nomadly is a modern full stack SaaS platform designed to simplify group travel planning. It brings trip organization, collaboration, budgeting, media sharing, and social discovery into a single unified experience. Built with scalability and real world use cases in mind, Nomadly evolves from a trip planner into a travel focused social network with AI powered planning capabilities.

## ✨ Why Nomadly

Group travel planning is often chaotic. People rely on WhatsApp, spreadsheets, notes, and multiple booking apps, which leads to confusion, duplicated effort, and poor coordination.

Nomadly solves this by:
- Centralizing all trip related information in one platform
- Enabling real time collaboration for groups
- Making travel plans structured, visual, and reusable
- Preparing the foundation for AI powered itinerary generation and social discovery

## 🏛️ Architecture & Patterns

### Backend: Domain-Driven Modular Design
Each module (auth, users, trips, etc.) follows a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// Module structure example: modules/auth/
auth/
├── auth.controller.ts  // Handle HTTP requests/responses
├── auth.service.ts     // Business logic and database operations
├── auth.middleware.ts  // Request validation and error handling
├── auth.routes.ts      // Route definitions
├── auth.types.ts       // TypeScript types and interfaces
├── utils/              // Auth-specific utilities (JWT, CSRF)
└── index.ts            // Module barrel export
```

**Key Patterns:**
- **Separation of concerns**: Controller (HTTP layer) → Service (business logic) → Model (database)
- **Middleware-based auth**: JWT verification, CSRF protection, ownership validation
- **Error handling**: Centralized error codes and messages
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
- **Database models**: Mongoose schemas with validation

### Frontend: Feature-Driven + Centralized Patterns
Organized by features with shared utilities:

**Async Operation Management** - The `useAsyncAction` hook eliminates boilerplate:
```typescript
const { execute, isLoading, error } = useAsyncAction({
  showToast: true,                    // Auto error toast
  errorMessage: 'Custom message',
  onSuccess: () => { /* callback */ }
});

await execute(async () => {
  await api.saveData(data);
  dispatch(updateState());
});
```

**Centralized Utilities:**
- **toastMessages.ts**: Unified messaging (AUTH, PROFILE, TRIP, IMAGE, GENERIC)
- **errorHandling.ts**: Error extraction and display
- **useNavigation.ts**: Navigation data and state
- **useImageUpload.ts**: Image validation and upload

**State Management Strategy:**
- **Redux Toolkit**: Persisted state (auth token, user, trips)
- **React Hooks**: Operation state (loading, errors)
- **Local State**: UI state (modals, pickers, form focus)

### Frontend Patterns Detail

## 🧪 Running Locally

### Backend Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushthakur13/nomadly.git
cd nomadly/server
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file from the example:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the server (TypeScript):
```
npx ts-node-dev --respawn src/server.ts
```

### Client Setup
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

**Dependencies installed:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Axios for HTTP requests
- react-hot-toast for notifications
- Mapbox GL for map visualization
- Vite as build tool

The client expects `VITE_API_URL` to point to your server (default `http://localhost:4444/api`). The server sets an httpOnly refresh token cookie and the client keeps the access token in memory, using a CSRF token for refresh calls.

**Build optimization:** Uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds with automatic code splitting.

### Two-terminal workflow
- Terminal A (server): `cd server && npm run dev`
- Terminal B (client): `cd client && npm run dev`

Optionally, create a root-level script with `concurrently` to run both at once.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

### Server (.env)
See [server/.env.example](server/.env.example) for a complete list, including:
- `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, optional expiries
- `CLIENT_URL`, `CORS_ORIGIN`
- `CLOUDINARY_*`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

### Client (.env)
See [client/.env.example](client/.env.example):
- `VITE_API_URL` — Backend API base URL (default: `http://localhost:4444/api`)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — Google OAuth client ID for authentication
- `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` — Mapbox access token for map features

---

## 🔐 Auth & Security (Overview)
- Access token: stored in memory on the client
- Refresh token: httpOnly cookie set by the server
- CSRF: token persisted in localStorage and sent as `x-csrf-token` for refresh/logout
- 401 handling: client automatically attempts refresh; on failure, user is redirected to login
- Google Identity Services: One Tap and button supported; configure Authorized Origin for `http://localhost:5173`
